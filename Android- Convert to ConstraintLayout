//Convert to constraint layout

Add ConstraintLayout to your project

To use ConstraintLayout in your project, proceed as follows:

    1. Ensure you have the maven.google.com repository declared in your module-level build.gradle file:

    repositories {
        maven {
            url 'https://maven.google.com'
        }
    }

	2. Add the library as a dependency in the same build.gradle file:

	dependencies {
		compile 'com.android.support.constraint:constraint-layout:1.0.2'
	}

	3. In the toolbar or sync notification, click Sync Project with Gradle Files.


Now you're ready to build your layout with ConstraintLayout.
